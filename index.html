  <h1 class="h1">Our History</h1><p class="lead aboutUsText">We are Conundrum. A Draenor based horde guild  who are actively recruiting for World of Warcraft: Shadowlands. Our history goes back into the end of Warlords of Draenor on the Genjuros server, where a new guild called Drifters would emerge to conquer all content that Legion had to offer. After clearing the first 2 raids and taking a brake Drifters got reorganized into Infinitus, this time changing realm to the Defias Brotherhood RP server. As Infinitus most of the current members met each other and raided, played together and even started having guild meet ups.  Battle for Azeroth would bring us a new chapter in our lives when we had to reorganize again because of lack of players on the server and because the guild wanted to be so much more. We transfered to the Draenor server in an attempt to find new like minded players and because the ambitions of the guild had grown. Here it was where we cleared the first raids, teamed up for awesome mythic plus content and even killed a few bosses on Mythic. We are looking for players who know that World of Warcraft is about community. Players who have heard about some guilds meeting up, year after year, and think that forming such a friendship is something they want. We are looking for players who want to put in the effort for themselves but more so for their brothers in arms in game and friends in real life. If you are looking for a guild to make friends in, raid high end content, do high end mythic plus but also get to meet new friends along the way, consider joining!</p>
  <h1 class="h1">Our Vision</h1><p class="lead aboutUsText">We are grateful for the journey that brought us here but even more so we are excited to see what lies ahead. Most of us have played this game since day one and we, just like you, have noticed that most guilds have one focus. If they are doing too well in the raiding scene they probably aren't very friendly. If they are too friendly then that's a tell tale sign that it's no more but a glorified social guild. We have had our fair share of drama with this aswell. People are very different, some wanna raid mythic, others want to raid heroic, some opt to raid either mythic or heroic but not put in the effort for either of them relying on their guild mates to pick them up and carry most boss fights.  In Shadowlands our vision is to create a guild that is truly capable of offering everything people log into the game for. Want to raid mythic? Sure, we raid 2-3 times a week and we would love to see you there! Want to raid Heroic content? That's great, join our HC only team and have fun! Want to do pet battles, fishing, PvP or any other activity the game has to offer? Awesome! We have a rank just for you so that it's easier to find guild members who share your same passions. All this cannot be accomplished without players and without the right mentality. If you are the type of person who knows that in order to get ahead you have to put in the work, you might be the person we're looking for. If you are willing to put in the effort for every activity you want to do then we would like to meet you. Help us create a one of a kind guild and be a part of our story. </p>

      <h6 class="text-center">Guild Master</h6>
    <p>Willow has been playing World of Warcraft since he was 15 years old. He started out in the raiding scene with Karazhan, Mount Hyjal and Black Temple. He loved it but at his heart he was drawn towards PvP more than anything else. This started a on again, off again relationship with the game because for PvP you don't care about what raid patch you're in. You just come back, gear up and have fun in arenas or battlegrounds. That stopped in Warlords of Draenor when he was set on making his own guild. He started off with Drifters, then in Legion came Infinitus and then he finally created Conundrum. Along the way he made many great friends that would be his inspiration for keeping things going, organizing guild meet ups and generally trying to keep everyone from killing each other.</p>

    <div class="cardText">
      <h6 class="text-center">Officer</h6>
    <p>Peekaboe has started playing WoW in late 2005. His first character was a orc warrior which he mained for tanking. After some time in getting the hang of the game and raiding Molten Core and Zul'gurub the next new expansion would bring him a new perspective on the game. He started raiding Karazhan and PvPing and and the search started for a proper guild in which to do content. In Wrath of the Lich he found the guild he was looking for and started gaining the experience that would actually end up making him an officer within Conundrum. The only expansion he has not played is MoP and nowadays he's extatic to play Shadowlands for the social aspect and content that WoW has. Hit him up whenever you need a chill and awesome guy to hang with.</p>

    <div class="cardText">
      <h6 class="text-center">Officer</h6>
    <p>Sebi is not new to World of Warcraft at all. He has been playing since vanilla. Even though most of the time he played on unofficial servers, he gave retail WoW a shot since the end of Warlords of Draenor and he is still salty about not completing the Gold Challenge Mode since he was too fresh for that. Some of the more notable achievements so far include being a shaman class leader in vanilla (healer spec), pushing for the Burning Crusade raid attunements (including raiding) and fast forward to Legion going for the Mage Tower challenges. Being more of a "lone survivor" post-TBC he wants to come back to the social aspect and contribute as much to his ability towards a nice community and push those M+ keys and raids. He is usually a chill guy who loves to lend a hand whenever needed. </p>

    <div class="cardText">
      <h6 class="text-center">Officer</h6>
    <p>Ozzy started playing the game in late Burning Crusade, casually on and off, mainly interested in PvE but didn't mind doing the casual PvP match here and there. He maintained his casual aproach to the game playing all expansions apart from Mists of Pandaria. He met Willow at the end of Legion when the guild was doing casual Heroic raids getting ready for Battle for Azeroth. It is there that he developed a passion for raiding and took his approach and skills to the next level. After that he decided to get more involved in the game actively helping other guild members and even becoming an officer of Conundrum in the process. Now he is really excited for Shadowlands, new content, what the social aspects will bring and for leading the guild with the rest of management. </p>

  <div class="col-md-12 rules">
  <h1 class="aboutUs text-center" id="rules"> &middot; Rules &middot;</h1>
  <div class="row firstRow">
      <div class="col-lg-3">Always be prepared for the raid you want to be a part of. Do not expect to be carried. When people underperfom constantly it leads to frustration for the other people that are putting in the work.</div>
       <div class="col-lg-3">  Guild banter and trash talk will always happen. It's a sign of people becoming comfortable with one another. However if someone feels it's going to far and you are asked to stop: stop it.</div>
       <div class="col-lg-3">  Always be on time. We use the guild calendar to see what players we have for the activities we want to do. If you sign up and don't show up or show up and don't sign up, no spot is guaranteed. Ever.</div>
       <div class="col-lg-3">  Discord is a must for almost all activities. It's hard to create a community with just relying on writing in chat. When and if you can we strongly suggest you hang out in discord and mingle.</div>
  </div>
   <div class="row secondRow">
      <div class="col-lg-3">  Constructive criticism is always appreciated. We all strive to be the best players we can be on our character and good advice is always welcomed, however never go to far with it when you see a person is actively trying.</div>
       <div class="col-lg-3">  Listening to advice is not the same as following it. We are all for hearing your thoughts on the way the guild is going however, if we don't go the direction you want that doesn't mean we are not listening, it means we don't agree with you.</div>
       <div class="col-lg-3">  Any member above the Trial rank can ask for a Guild Management meeting to express either positive or negative things. If one does so he will be summoned in the next officer meeting. If it's an emergency, one will be organized right away.</div>
       <div class="col-lg-3">  We believe in free speech. You can say whatever you want whenever you want but that doesn't mean you're free from consequences. Always use common sense, it gets you far.</div>
    </div>
     <div class="row thirdRow secondRow">
      <div class="col-lg-3"> We have a list of addons that are a must when you raid with us. These addons have proved to be indispensable  over the years and we do check for them. The addons are: <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/deadly-boss-mods">Deadly Boss Mods</a>, <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/exorsus-raid-tools">Exorsus Raids tools</a>,<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rclootcouncil"> RC Loot council</a>, and<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2"> Weak Auras.</a></div>
       <div class="col-lg-3"> Make sure that all your gear is enchanted, socketed and that the flasks/pots you're using are the appropriate one for that patch. (Yes we did have a guy that was using flasks from a previous expansion cause: "hEy I hAvE fLaSks LiKe YoU sAid").</div>
       <div class="col-lg-3">  We require a mandatory 2 days attendace for raiding. Now let's define mandatory: for us it means show up for the content you signed up for when you joined. Life happens and we get that, but if you show up for 2 raids/month, we are not getting anywhere. </div>
       <div class="col-lg-3">  Our members are important to us. If you are the type of player that thinks you don't have to do X or Y with the guild because "it's fine they will just find a replacement", then we are not the guild you're looking for. We need players interested in community.</div>

  <h1 class="aboutUs text-center" id="faq">&middot; F A Q &middot;</h1>
  <div class="col-lg-12"><h3 class="text-center">Q: When do you guys raid?</h3><p class="lead text-center">Our raid times and days are Wednesday and Monday from 7 Server time. In order for you to be elligible you must have signed up in the calendar.</p></div>
    <div class="col-lg-12"><h3 class="text-center">Q: Can I also bring a friend to the guild?</h3><p class="lead text-center">Normally yes. If it's just a friend then we are always welcoming to new players, however if we are talking about 'large groups' such as when another guild is disbanding<br> then we will have an officer meeting to decide on our next move.</p></div>
    <div class="col-lg-12"><h3 class="text-center">Q: When do you guys raid?</h3><p class="lead text-center">Our raid times and days are Wednesday and Monday from 7 Server time. In order for you to be elligible you must have signed up in the calendar.</p></div>
    <div class="col-lg-12"><h3 class="text-center">Q: I usually don't fit in or don't want to talk. Is that ok?</h3><p class="lead text-center">Yes! That's absolutely no problem on our part, with the following mention: because most people can invoke this aspect of their personality all we ask is just stay on discord, muted and listen.<br> If after a few tries of this you still feel the same then by all means just be there for the content.</p></div>
    <div class="col-lg-12"><h3 class="text-center">Q: How do you guys sort BoE's that might drop?</h3><p class="lead text-center">Usually high value BoE's end up in the guild bank as gold<br> after an auction or if one of our own players buys it at a discount. The reason for this is the fact that we provide flasks/food for every raid so that you can just enjoy the game.</p></div>
     <div class="col-lg-12"><h3 class="text-center">Q: How do I join you guys?</h3><p class="lead text-center">Easily : if in the past you had to go through a lenghty 'application form' in order to be considered now all you have to do is check the bottom of the page <br> and click the discord icon. When you get there you will be able to contact either Willow directly or an officer and have a chat with him about joining. It's that easy.</p></div>
     <div class="col-lg-12"><h3 class="text-center">Q: What if I have a problem with one of the guild members or management?</h3><p class="lead text-center">Any issue with our guild members should be brought to the immediate attention of one of the officers or the GM. <br> If the problem is with anyone from management, talk directly to the GM. If the issue is with the guild master then you can call all 3 officers for a chat in the GM's absence.</p></div>
     <div class="col-lg-12"><h3 class="text-center">Q: What type of content do you guys normally raid?</h3><p class="lead text-center"> At the start of an expansion we always clear the first normal raid to get a feel for it. After that we mainly focus on Heroic content until we can clear it in one go.<br>After that we through ourselves in the mythic raiding scene....Good luck to us.</p></div>
